Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbcca", K = 2
Output: 5

Explanation: The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is "bcbcc" with characters 'b' and 'c'.

Example 2:
Input: S = abcde, K = 1
Output: 1

Explanation: Since all the characters of the strings are different, the substring length with K distinct characters depends on K itself.
