## TWO SUM
[Found Here!!!](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### QUESTION

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

'''
    Example:

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    
'''

### SOLUTION

'''

    My proposed soltion uses a nested for loop to loop through 2 copies of a list and add each other eg [2, 7, 11, 15] + [2, 7, 11, 15] one by one for each item. This is a "brute force" solution. And can be improved.
