Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a classic interview question, because its solution indicates typical two-dimensional dynamic programming. Most of the difficult problems related to string are similar to LCS problem, such as Edit distance. Moreover, LCS algorithm is worth mastering because it can be utilized to solve other relative problems effectively.

Given str1 and str2, find out the length of the longest common subsequence.
```
Input: str1 = "abcde", str2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" whose length is 3
```

The DP solution is a practical implementation of the below:
